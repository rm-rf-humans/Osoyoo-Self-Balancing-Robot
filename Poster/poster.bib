  abstract      = "A two-wheeled self-balancing robot (TWSBR) is non-linear and
                   unstable system. This study compares the performance of
                   model-based and data-based control strategies for TWSBRs,
                   with an explicit practical educational approach. Model-based
                   control (MBC) algorithms such as Lead-Lag and PID control
                   require a proficient dynamic modeling and mathematical
                   manipulation to drive the linearized equations of motions
                   and develop the appropriate controller. On the other side,
                   data-based control (DBC) methods, like fuzzy control,
                   provide a simpler and quicker approach to designing
                   effective controllers without needing in-depth understanding
                   of the system model. In this paper, the advantages and
                   disadvantages of both MBC and DBC using a TWSBR are
                   illustrated. All controllers were implemented and tested on
                   the OSOYOO self-balancing kit, including an Arduino
                   microcontroller, MPU-6050 sensor, and DC motors. The control
                   law and the user interface are constructed using the
                   LabVIEW-LINX toolkit. A real-time hardware-in-loop
                   experiment validates the results, highlighting controllers
                   that can be implemented on a cost-effective platform.",

  abstract      = "A two-wheeled self-balancing robot is an example of an
                   inverse pendulum and is an inherently non-linear, unstable
                   system. The fundamental concept of the proposed framework
                   ``Epersist'' is to overcome the challenge of
                   counterbalancing an initially unstable system by delivering
                   robust control mechanisms, Proportional Integral
                   Derivative(PID), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Moreover,
                   the micro-controller NodeMCUESP32 and inertial sensor in the
                   Epersist employ fewer computational procedures to give
                   accurate instruction regarding the spin of wheels to the
                   motor driver, which helps control the wheels and balance the
                   robot. This framework also consists of the mathematical
                   model of the PID controller and a novel self-trained
                   advantage actor-critic algorithm as the RL agent. After
                   several experiments, control variable calibrations are made
                   as the benchmark values to attain the angle of static
                   equilibrium. This ``Epersist'' framework proposes PID and
                   RL-assisted functional prototypes and simulations for better
                   utility.",

               on complete mathematic modeling and designing a mathematical
               model based controller for such system. This paper analyzed
               mathematical model of the system. Then, the authors successfully
               applied a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller for this
               system. This controller was tested with different case of system
               condition. Controlling results was proved to work well and
